### 什么是 Kafka

* [**Introduction**](http://kafka.apache.org/intro)

* A streaming platform has three key capabilities:
  * Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
  * Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
  * Process streams of records as they occur.

* Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:
  * Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications.
  * Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data.
